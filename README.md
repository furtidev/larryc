# Larryc
Larryc is a dictionary-search engine that runs in your terminal with a pleasing UI. Larryc is depending on the [dictionary api](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). And, the UI is written in [Rich framework](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

## Purpose
First of all, nobody these days carries dictionaries. Second of all, not everyone likes to use the browser for everything. Especially me. I feel like small things like this should be done in the terminal, which is fast and straight to point. Larryc is **maybe** going to solve the *dictionary* crysis. That's what I'm calling it. 

## Installation & Usage
Cross-platform (Python must be installed):
```bash
# install the package
pip install larryc

# usage
python -m larryc <word>
```
